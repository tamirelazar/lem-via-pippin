# Governance

Welcome to the **Pippin Framework** Governance Document! This document outlines how decisions are made and the roles within the project. Our governance model emphasizes community participation, ensuring that contributors have a significant role in shaping the project's future. The project owner serves as a mediator for major changes or conflicts to maintain the project's integrity and vision.
