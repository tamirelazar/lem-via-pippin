+/architect i want to change the chat window behaviour. right now a user message triggers a chat completion right away; i would like to disconnect the two stages, so that a new message will be registered to memory regularly with an additional 'pending' attribute, and 2 new activities 'check_pending' and 'answer_message' will be implemented to integrate the chat into the overall activity selection process. help me plan this change
