## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Be nice!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Ensure your issue hasn't been reported already.
2. **Open a New Issue**: Provide a clear title and detailed description, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
3. **Select Appropriate Labels**: Use labels like `bug`, `feature-request`, or `documentation` to categorize your issue.

### Suggesting Features

1. **Open an Issue**: Label it as `feature-request`.
2. **Describe the Feature**: Explain the problem it solves and its benefits.
3. **Provide Use Cases**: Share examples or scenarios where the feature would be useful.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the Pippin repository.
2. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive name, e.g., `feature/add-authentication`.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Follow the existing code style and project goals.
4. **Write Tests**: Include tests to maintain code quality.
5. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass.
6. **Submit the PR**: Provide a clear description, reference related issues, and follow the PR template.

## Style Guide

- **Code Style**: Follow the existing style of code.
- **Documentation**: Write clear and concise docs for new features or changes.
- **Commit Messages**: Use meaningful messages, preferably following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Issue and Pull Request Tagging

### Available Tags

**Issue Tags:**
- `bug`: Unexpected behavior or error.
- `feature-request`: Suggestion for a new feature.
- `documentation`: Improvements or additions to docs.
- `enhancement`: Improvements to existing features.
- `question`: Inquiries about using the framework.
- `discussion`: Topics requiring community input.
- `good first issue`: Suitable for first-time contributors.
- `help wanted`: Contributions needed.
- `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`: Indicate issue priority.
- `needs-triage`: New issues awaiting review.

**Pull Request Tags:**
- `bugfix`: Resolves a bug.
- `feature`: Introduces new features.
- `documentation`: Updates or adds documentation.
- `enhancement`: Improves existing features.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality.
- `tests`: Adds or modifies tests.
- `chore`: Routine tasks and maintenance.
- `WIP`: Work in progress.

### Tagging Guidelines

- **Consistent Usage**: Apply tags consistently for clarity.
- **Descriptive Labels**: Use labels that accurately describe the issue or PR.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Select the most appropriate single tag.
- **Automate When Possible**: Use GitHub Actions to assign `needs-triage` to new issues.

### Escalating and Prioritizing Issues

1. **Initial Triage**: Maintainers review `needs-triage` issues, assign appropriate labels, and set priority (`high`, `medium`, `low`).
2. **Community Voting**: Encourage reactions (e.g., üëç) to indicate interest.
3. **Maintainer Decisions**: Prioritize based on impact, alignment with goals, and available resources.
4. **Milestone Assignment**: Assign issues to upcoming releases based on priority.
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess open issues to adjust priorities as needed.

## Keeping Pippin Simple

- **Minimal Integrations**: Avoid unnecessary integrations. Focus on core functionalities.
- **Modular Design**: Encourage modularity to allow users to extend functionality without bloating the framework.

## Using Composio

- **Leverage Composio**: Use Composio for configurations and integrations to maintain consistency.
- **Documentation**: Document any changes involving Composio clearly.

## Enhancing Framework Usability

- **Improved Documentation**: Cover more use cases and provide clearer instructions.
- **Better Error Messages**: Make error messages descriptive to aid troubleshooting.
- **User Experience**: Streamline workflows and reduce complexity for end-users.

## External Integrations

- **Prefer External APIs**: Integrate external APIs outside the core framework. Composio is a good option, but would be great to look into setting up Pippin Skill/Activities repository we can pull from.

## Expanding Pippin with Skills and Activities (Planned)

To enhance **Pippin Framework** without compromising its simplicity, we plan to introduce **Skills and Activities**‚Äîmodular components that extend functionality by leveraging existing functions and integrations from other frameworks.

### Future Skills and Activities Repository

- **Repository Name**: `pippin-skills`
- **Purpose**: Centralized location for community-contributed skills and activities.
- **Contribution**: Guidelines for contributing skills and activities will be provided once the repository is established.

### Benefits of Skills and Activities

- **Modularity**: Easily integrate or remove functionalities without affecting the core.
- **Community-Driven**: Leverage the community's expertise to expand Pippin's capabilities.
- **Maintain Simplicity**: Keep the core framework lightweight by offloading extensions.

### Getting Involved

Stay tuned for updates on the **Skills and Activities Repository**. In the meantime, feel free to discuss ideas or express interest in contributing skills through our [discussion forums](LINK_TO_FORUMS).

## Inspired Projects & Forks (We don't have this yet)

- **Dedicated Document**: Maintain a list of inspired projects, forks, and iterations. 
- **Submit Your Project**: Add your project by opening a pull request with details.
- **Describe Your Adaptation**: Include a brief description of how your project extends Pippin.

## Additional Tips

- **Stay Updated**: Regularly sync your fork with the main repository.
- **Ask for Feedback**: Seek feedback on your ideas or implementations.
- **Be Respectful**: Engage respectfully with all contributors.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your contributions are well-tested to maintain reliability.
